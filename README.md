# Encoder & Decoder built with Go
This is an Encoder and eventually decoder that I built in Go. Originally built in C++ for CSE school project but refactoring into Go. Interested to see how the run times compare for large files. So far the encoding is working nicely and I think close to finished.

## Running
```bash
go run main.go <input.txt >output.txt
```
